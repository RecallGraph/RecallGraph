/*
 * ### commitProvider
 * Commits nodes to the event log whose states no longer match with the log.
 *
 * **This endpoint DOES NOT accept the Node-Glob scope in the path pattern.**
 *
 * Two types of commits are supported:
 * 1. Existing nodes that are yet to be tracked by the event log, or are tracked but have been modified outside
 * of RecallGraph's purview, and hence have gone out of sync with its event log.
 * 2. Tracked nodes that have been deleted through means outside of RecallGraph, and so the event log still
 * believes them to exist.
 *
 *
 * **Args:**
 * - `path` - The path pattern to pick nodes which should be committed.
 * - `types` - An optional array having one or both of the values `existing` and `deleted`. This decides the
 * type of commit to be processed. If omitted, both types are processed.
 *
 *
 * **Return:**
 *
 * The contents of the result returned by the method is identical to the contents of the response
 * body of the corresponding
 * [HTTP API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/RecallGraph/RecallGraph/1.0.0#/Event/commit),
 * invoked with identical input, except when the method throws an error.
 * In the latter case, the error message would be identical to the error response of the HTTP call.
 *
 *
 * **Errors:**
 *
 * Any error that occurs while executing the method is thrown back to the caller.
 *
 *
 * **Examples:**
 * 1. Default - process both types:
 *  ```
 *  commitProvider('/c/vertex_collection')
 *  ```
 * 1. Only process the _deleted_ type:
 *  ```
 *  commitProvider('/c/vertex_collection', ['deleted'])
 *  ```
