      Two types of commits are supported:
      
      1. Existing nodes that are yet to be tracked by the event log, or are tracked but have been modified outside
        of RecallGraph's purview, and hence have gone out of sync with its event log.
      2. Tracked nodes that have been deleted through means outside of RecallGraph, and so the event log still believes
        them to exist.
