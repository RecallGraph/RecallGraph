# Contributing to RecallGraph

Thanks for taking the time to help improve _RecallGraph_!

A formal contribution guideline wiki is in the works. In the meantime, please adhere to the following guiding principles:

- Stick to the exisiting [coding and formatting styles](https://standardjs.com/),
- Maintain the current file and folder structure. [Get in touch](https://gitter.im/RecallGraph/community) before starting development and I will go over a few basic code organization policies.
- Write test cases for every new piece of functionality and ensure good code coverage (> 85% at present). Automated builds and coverage reports are run on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/github/RecallGraph/RecallGraph) for each PR.
